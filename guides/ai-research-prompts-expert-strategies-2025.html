        </ul>

        <h2>Core Prompting Principles for Research</h2>

        <h3>1. Define Your Research Context Clearly</h3>

        <p><strong>Poor Prompt:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>Help me research climate change</code></pre>

        <p><strong>Better Prompt:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>I'm conducting a systematic literature review on the economic impacts of climate change 
on agricultural productivity in developing countries from 2010-2023. Help me identify 
key themes, methodological approaches, and research gaps in this area, focusing on 
peer-reviewed studies published in agricultural economics and climate science journals.</code></pre>

        <h3>2. Specify Your Research Methodology</h3>

        <p><strong>Include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Research approach (qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods)</li>

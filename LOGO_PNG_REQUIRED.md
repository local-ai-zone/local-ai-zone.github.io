# Logo PNG File Required

The SEO optimization implementation requires a `logo.png` file to be created from the existing `logo.svg` file.

## Requirements:
- Convert `logo.svg` to `logo.png` format
- Recommended dimensions: 120x32 pixels (matching the SVG)
- Ensure transparency is preserved
- Optimize for web use (keep file size under 50KB)

## Usage:
The `logo.png` file will be used for:
- Favicon display in browser tabs
- Social media sharing previews
- Search engine rich snippets
- Structured data logo references

## Current Status:
- ✅ SVG logo exists and is properly referenced
- ❌ PNG logo needs to be created from SVG
- ✅ All HTML references are in place and ready for PNG file

## Next Steps:
1. Convert logo.svg to logo.png using an image editor or conversion tool
2. Place the logo.png file in the project root directory
3. Test favicon display and social media previews

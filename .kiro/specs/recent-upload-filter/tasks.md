# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add uploadDate field to data processing pipeline





  - Modify the `_generate_output()` method in `scripts/simplified_gguf_fetcher.py` to include `uploadDate` field from raw data
  - Extract `created_at` from processed model data and add it to the output entry as `uploadDate`
  - Handle missing or invalid dates by setting `uploadDate` to null
  - Run the data processing to generate updated gguf_models.json with uploadDate field
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.4_

- [x] 2. Add recent upload filter UI and basic functionality





  - Add the recent upload filter dropdown HTML to the filter section in `index.html` with calendar icon
  - Include filter options: "All Time", "Last 7 days", "Last 30 days", "Last 90 days", "Last 6 months"
  - Add event listener for the recent upload filter dropdown in `setupEventHandlers()` method
  - Extend the `handleFilter()` method to include date-based filtering logic with safe date parsing
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.5_

- [x] 3. Complete filter integration and optimization





  - Add recent upload filter to the active filters display system and `clearAllFilters()` method
  - Implement date calculation caching and optimize filtering performance for large datasets
  - Add error handling for edge cases (no models in timeframe, invalid dates)
  - Test basic functionality with different time ranges and filter combinations
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 6.2, 6.4_

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement automated GitHub workflows to keep the GGUF model loader application updated automatically every 24 hours. The automation will handle data updates, dependency management, and deployment processes to ensure the application always displays current model information without manual intervention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the GGUF model data to be automatically fetched from Hugging Face and updated every 24 hours, so that users always see the latest available models without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 24 hours have passed since the last update THEN the system SHALL run the simplified_gguf_fetcher.py script to fetch latest model data
2. WHEN the script completes successfully THEN the system SHALL update data/raw_models_data.json and gguf_models.json files
3. WHEN data files are updated THEN the system SHALL commit and push the changes to the main branch
4. IF the data fetch fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
5. WHEN data updates are successful THEN the system SHALL update the GitHub Pages deployment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want Node.js and Python dependencies to be automatically updated, so that the application stays secure and uses the latest features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the weekly automation runs THEN the system SHALL check for npm and pip dependency updates
2. WHEN security updates are available THEN the system SHALL automatically apply them and create a pull request
3. WHEN minor version updates are available THEN the system SHALL create a pull request for review
4. IF dependency updates cause test failures THEN the system SHALL revert the changes and create an issue
5. WHEN dependency updates are successful THEN the system SHALL update package-lock.json and requirements.txt files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated testing to run before any updates are deployed, so that broken changes don't reach users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any automated changes are made THEN the system SHALL run the comprehensive engagement tests and validation scripts
2. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL proceed with GitHub Pages deployment
3. IF any tests fail THEN the system SHALL halt the deployment and create an issue with test results
4. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate a test report and upload as workflow artifact
5. WHEN critical tests fail THEN the system SHALL send a notification to repository maintainers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated deployment to GitHub Pages, so that updates are delivered to users without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL build the static site assets
2. WHEN build is successful THEN the system SHALL deploy to GitHub Pages
3. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL run smoke tests against the live site
4. IF any deployment fails THEN the system SHALL create an issue with deployment logs
5. WHEN deployment is complete THEN the system SHALL verify the site is accessible and model data is loading correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to receive notifications about automation status, so that I can monitor the system and respond to issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL send a success notification
2. WHEN automation encounters errors THEN the system SHALL send detailed error notifications
3. WHEN critical failures occur THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts
4. WHEN automation is skipped or disabled THEN the system SHALL log the reason
5. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL include relevant logs and status information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the automation to be configurable, so that I can adjust schedules and behavior without modifying workflow files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration changes are needed THEN the system SHALL support GitHub repository variables for key settings
2. WHEN the schedule needs adjustment THEN the system SHALL allow cron expression configuration via repository variables
3. WHEN certain steps need to be disabled THEN the system SHALL support feature flags in workflow inputs
4. WHEN automation behavior needs customization THEN the system SHALL read from .github/automation-config.json file
5. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages in workflow logs

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds hardware requirement tags to each model's data structure to enable hardware-based filtering and selection. The system will automatically calculate and assign hardware requirements including minimum CPU cores, RAM, GPU necessity, and OS compatibility based on model characteristics like size, parameters, and quantization type. The output will be structured data ready for UI consumption.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data processing system, I want to enrich each model's data with hardware requirement fields, so that downstream UI components can display and filter based on hardware compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is processed THEN the system SHALL add a minCpuCores field with integer value
2. WHEN a model is processed THEN the system SHALL add a minRamGB field with numeric value
3. WHEN a model is processed THEN the system SHALL add a gpuRequired field with boolean value
4. WHEN a model is processed THEN the system SHALL add an osSupported field with array of supported OS strings
5. WHEN hardware requirement fields are added THEN they SHALL be included in the model's JSON data structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data processing system, I want to automatically calculate hardware requirements based on model characteristics, so that the hardware requirement data is accurate and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is processed THEN the system SHALL calculate minRamGB as approximately double the model size in GB
2. WHEN a model uses efficient quantization (4-bit) THEN the system SHALL reduce RAM requirements by approximately 30%
3. WHEN a model has ≤2B parameters THEN the system SHALL assign 2-4 CPU cores as minimum requirement
4. WHEN a model has ~7B parameters THEN the system SHALL assign 6-8 CPU cores as minimum requirement
5. WHEN a model has ≥13B parameters THEN the system SHALL assign 8-12 CPU cores as minimum requirement
6. WHEN a model has ≥13B parameters OR requires GPU architecture THEN the system SHALL set gpuRequired to true
7. WHEN a model is designed for CPU inference and is small/quantized THEN the system SHALL set gpuRequired to false
8. WHEN calculating OS support THEN the system SHALL default to ["Windows", "Linux", "macOS"] unless specific incompatibilities are known

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want hardware requirement calculations to be configurable and extensible, so that I can adjust the logic as new model types and hardware emerge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hardware calculation logic needs updating THEN the system SHALL allow modification without changing core model processing code
2. WHEN new hardware requirement types are needed THEN the system SHALL support adding new requirement fields
3. WHEN calculation parameters need adjustment THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options for thresholds and multipliers
4. WHEN the system processes models THEN it SHALL log hardware requirement calculations for debugging and validation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data consumer, I want hardware requirements to be provided in a consistent data format, so that they can be reliably processed by UI and filtering components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hardware requirements are generated THEN they SHALL use consistent data types (integer for CPU cores, number for RAM GB, boolean for GPU required, array for OS support)
2. WHEN hardware requirements are generated THEN they SHALL use standardized field names across all models
3. WHEN hardware requirements cannot be calculated THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate default values or null indicators
4. WHEN models are exported THEN hardware requirement fields SHALL be included in the JSON output structure

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Enhance the existing GGUF Model Discovery interface by adding system requirements display to model cards and adding navigation buttons for popular AI tools. This builds on the existing hardware requirements tagging system to provide users with clear hardware compatibility information and quick access to recommended AI platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing models, I want to see system requirements on each model card, so that I can quickly determine if a model is compatible with my hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a model card THEN the system SHALL display minimum CPU cores requirement
2. WHEN a user views a model card THEN the system SHALL display minimum RAM requirement in GB
3. WHEN a model requires GPU THEN the system SHALL display GPU requirement information
4. WHEN a model does not require GPU THEN the system SHALL not display GPU requirement information
5. WHEN a user views system requirements THEN they SHALL be displayed in a clear, readable format with appropriate icons

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user new to local AI, I want quick access to popular AI platforms, so that I can easily get started with running models locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the main page THEN the system SHALL display three navigation buttons below the "Local AI Zone" description
2. WHEN the navigation buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL include LM Studio, Ollama, and GGUF Loader options
3. WHEN a user clicks the LM Studio button THEN the system SHALL navigate to https://lmstudio.ai
4. WHEN a user clicks the Ollama button THEN the system SHALL navigate to https://ollama.com
5. WHEN a user clicks the GGUF Loader button THEN the system SHALL navigate to https://ggufloader.github.io

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user comparing AI platforms, I want to see descriptive labels for each platform, so that I can understand their key benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LM Studio button is displayed THEN it SHALL show "LM Studio – Easiest" as the label
2. WHEN the Ollama button is displayed THEN it SHALL show "Ollama – Fastest" as the label
3. WHEN the GGUF Loader button is displayed THEN it SHALL show "GGUF Loader – Lightest" as the label
4. WHEN navigation buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL have consistent styling and clear visual hierarchy

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on mobile devices, I want the navigation buttons and system requirements to be responsive, so that I can access this information on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views navigation buttons on mobile THEN they SHALL be properly sized and touch-friendly
2. WHEN a user views system requirements on mobile THEN they SHALL be readable and not overcrowded
3. WHEN the screen size changes THEN navigation buttons SHALL adapt to maintain usability
4. WHEN system requirements are displayed on small screens THEN they SHALL use appropriate text sizing and spacing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user browsing models, I want to filter models by their system requirements, so that I can find models that are compatible with my hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the filter section THEN the system SHALL provide a CPU cores filter option
2. WHEN a user views the filter section THEN the system SHALL provide a RAM requirement filter option
3. WHEN a user views the filter section THEN the system SHALL provide a GPU requirement filter option (GPU Required/Not Required/All)
4. WHEN a user applies hardware filters THEN the system SHALL show only models matching the selected criteria
5. WHEN hardware filters are combined with existing filters THEN the system SHALL apply all criteria together

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want the system requirements display to use existing hardware data, so that the implementation is consistent with current data structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying system requirements THEN the system SHALL use the existing minCpuCores field from model data
2. WHEN displaying system requirements THEN the system SHALL use the existing minRamGB field from model data
3. WHEN displaying system requirements THEN the system SHALL use the existing gpuRequired field from model data
4. WHEN hardware requirement data is missing THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with appropriate fallbacks

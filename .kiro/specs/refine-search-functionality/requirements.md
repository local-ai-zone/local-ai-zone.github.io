# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The "Refine Your Search" section in the GGUF Model Discovery interface is missing critical functionality that prevents users from effectively filtering and searching through the model catalog. While the UI elements exist, the underlying functionality for advanced search features, filter combinations, and user experience enhancements are not properly implemented.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user searching for models, I want advanced search functionality with autocomplete and search suggestions, so that I can quickly find relevant models without typing complete terms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the search box THEN the system SHALL provide autocomplete suggestions based on model names, types, and quantization formats
2. WHEN a user sees search suggestions THEN they SHALL be able to click on suggestions to apply them
3. WHEN a user searches for partial terms THEN the system SHALL return relevant results using fuzzy matching
4. WHEN a user clears the search THEN all search suggestions SHALL be hidden
5. WHEN search suggestions are displayed THEN they SHALL be keyboard navigable using arrow keys

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user filtering models, I want to see active filter indicators and be able to clear individual filters, so that I can understand what filters are applied and easily modify them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user applies any filter THEN the system SHALL display active filter tags showing which filters are applied
2. WHEN active filter tags are displayed THEN each tag SHALL have an 'X' button to remove that specific filter
3. WHEN a user clicks an 'X' on a filter tag THEN only that filter SHALL be removed while others remain active
4. WHEN all filters are cleared THEN the active filter tags section SHALL be hidden
5. WHEN filters are applied THEN the results count SHALL update to show "X of Y models" format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user browsing models, I want to save and restore my search and filter preferences, so that I can return to my preferred view without reconfiguring filters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user applies search terms and filters THEN the system SHALL save the state to browser localStorage
2. WHEN a user returns to the site THEN their previous search and filter state SHALL be restored
3. WHEN a user bookmarks a filtered view THEN the URL SHALL contain filter parameters for sharing
4. WHEN a user visits a URL with filter parameters THEN those filters SHALL be automatically applied
5. WHEN filter state is restored THEN all UI elements SHALL reflect the restored state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user comparing models, I want to sort by multiple criteria and see sort indicators, so that I can organize results according to my priorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a sort option THEN the system SHALL display a sort indicator showing current sort field and direction
2. WHEN a user clicks on the same sort option twice THEN the sort direction SHALL toggle between ascending and descending
3. WHEN models are sorted THEN the system SHALL maintain sort stability for equal values
4. WHEN sorting is applied with filters THEN the system SHALL sort only the filtered results
5. WHEN sort options are displayed THEN they SHALL include icons indicating sort direction

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on mobile devices, I want collapsible filter sections and touch-friendly controls, so that I can effectively use filters without cluttering the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views filters on mobile THEN filter groups SHALL be collapsible to save screen space
2. WHEN a user taps a filter group header THEN that group SHALL expand/collapse with smooth animation
3. WHEN filter dropdowns are opened on mobile THEN they SHALL be touch-friendly with adequate spacing
4. WHEN active filters are displayed on mobile THEN they SHALL wrap properly and remain readable
5. WHEN the clear filters button is used on mobile THEN it SHALL be easily tappable with proper touch target size

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user searching through large datasets, I want real-time search with debouncing and loading indicators, so that I get responsive feedback without overwhelming the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in search THEN the system SHALL debounce input with 300ms delay before searching
2. WHEN a search is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
3. WHEN search results are loading THEN the previous results SHALL remain visible with a loading overlay
4. WHEN a search completes THEN the loading indicator SHALL be hidden and results updated
5. WHEN search returns no results THEN the system SHALL display a helpful "no results found" message with suggestions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user filtering by hardware requirements, I want to see compatibility indicators and get recommendations, so that I can understand which models will work with my system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user applies hardware filters THEN models SHALL display compatibility status (Compatible/Requires Upgrade/Not Compatible)
2. WHEN a model is not compatible THEN the system SHALL show what hardware upgrades would be needed
3. WHEN hardware filters are applied THEN the system SHALL show a summary of hardware requirements being filtered for
4. WHEN no models match hardware filters THEN the system SHALL suggest relaxing specific requirements
5. WHEN hardware compatibility is shown THEN it SHALL use clear visual indicators (colors, icons)

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want the filter functionality to be performant and handle large datasets efficiently, so that users have a smooth experience even with thousands of models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN filtering large datasets THEN the system SHALL use indexed filtering for performance
2. WHEN multiple filters are applied THEN the system SHALL combine filters efficiently without redundant processing
3. WHEN search and filters are used together THEN the system SHALL optimize the order of operations for best performance
4. WHEN filter operations complete THEN they SHALL complete within 500ms for datasets up to 50,000 models
5. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN filter operations SHALL not cause memory leaks or excessive memory consumption

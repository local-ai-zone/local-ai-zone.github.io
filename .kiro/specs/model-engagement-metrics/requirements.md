# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Enhance the GGUF Model Discovery interface by adding community engagement metrics (like counts) from Hugging Face to help users identify popular and well-regarded models beyond just download counts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer browsing models, I want to see like counts, so that I can identify community-endorsed models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a model card THEN the system SHALL display the like count alongside existing metrics
2. WHEN a user sorts models THEN the system SHALL provide options to sort by like count
3. WHEN a user views model statistics THEN the system SHALL show engagement metrics with clear visual indicators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user comparing models, I want engagement metrics in the filter system, so that I can find highly-liked models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL provide range filters for like count
2. WHEN a user searches THEN the system SHALL maintain engagement metrics in filtered results
3. WHEN a user combines filters THEN the system SHALL apply engagement criteria alongside existing filters

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the Python fetcher, I want like data extracted automatically, so that the metadata includes community engagement metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Python script fetches model data THEN the system SHALL extract like count from Hugging Face API
2. WHEN the script processes models THEN the system SHALL include engagement metrics in the output JSON
3. WHEN the script encounters missing engagement data THEN the system SHALL default to 0 and log the occurrence

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user viewing model cards, I want clear visual representation of engagement metrics, so that I can quickly assess model popularity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a model card THEN the system SHALL display like count with appropriate heart icon
2. WHEN engagement metrics are high THEN the system SHALL provide visual emphasis (highlighting, badges)
3. WHEN metrics are unavailable THEN the system SHALL show "N/A" or hide the metric gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user browsing the model list, I want engagement metrics in the header statistics, so that I can understand the overall dataset engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the header THEN the system SHALL display total likes across all models
2. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL update engagement statistics for filtered results
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL show average engagement metrics per model

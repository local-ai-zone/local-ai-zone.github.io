# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves optimizing the scheduling of GitHub Actions workflows to prevent resource conflicts and ensure proper execution order. Currently, some workflows may run simultaneously or at suboptimal times, which can cause resource contention and potential failures. The goal is to stagger workflow execution times to ensure smooth automation pipeline operation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want workflows to run at different times throughout the day, so that they don't compete for resources and execute in the proper sequence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the daily-update workflow is scheduled THEN it SHALL run at 23:59 UTC daily
2. WHEN the prerender-models workflow is scheduled THEN it SHALL run at 4:00 AM UTC daily
3. WHEN the seo-optimization workflow is scheduled THEN it SHALL run at 5:00 AM UTC daily
4. WHEN the sync-docs-to-wiki workflow is scheduled THEN it SHALL NOT run at 12:00 PM UTC (noon)
5. WHEN workflows are updated THEN they SHALL maintain their existing trigger conditions (workflow_dispatch, workflow_run dependencies)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want workflows to maintain their dependency relationships, so that dependent workflows still execute in the correct order when their prerequisites complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the daily-update workflow completes successfully THEN the seo-optimization workflow SHALL still be triggered via workflow_run
2. WHEN the seo-optimization workflow completes successfully THEN the prerender-models workflow SHALL still be triggered via workflow_run
3. WHEN a workflow fails THEN dependent workflows SHALL NOT execute automatically
4. WHEN workflows have both schedule and workflow_run triggers THEN both trigger types SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to preserve manual workflow triggering capabilities, so that I can run workflows on-demand when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any workflow is updated THEN it SHALL retain the workflow_dispatch trigger
2. WHEN a workflow is manually triggered THEN it SHALL execute regardless of schedule timing
3. WHEN manual triggers are used THEN they SHALL bypass any rate limiting or scheduling constraints
4. WHEN workflows are manually triggered THEN they SHALL maintain the same execution logic as scheduled runs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a repository owner, I want the sync-docs-to-wiki workflow to avoid running during peak hours, so that it doesn't interfere with development activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sync-docs-to-wiki workflow is configured THEN it SHALL NOT have a scheduled trigger at 12:00 PM UTC
2. WHEN documentation files are pushed THEN the workflow SHALL still trigger on push events
3. WHEN the workflow runs THEN it SHALL maintain its existing rate limiting (1 hour minimum between runs)
4. WHEN the workflow is manually triggered THEN it SHALL execute regardless of time restrictions

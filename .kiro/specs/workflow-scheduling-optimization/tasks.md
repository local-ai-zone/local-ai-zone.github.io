# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Optimize GitHub workflow scheduling for all automation pipelines







  - Update daily-update.yml cron from `0 2 * * *` to `59 23 * * *` (23:59 UTC)
  - Update seo-optimization.yml cron from `0 3 * * *` to `0 5 * * *` (5:00 AM UTC)  
  - Keep prerender-models.yml at `0 4 * * *` (4:00 AM UTC) - no change needed
  - Confirm sync-docs-to-wiki.yml has no scheduled trigger (push-based only)
  - Preserve all workflow_dispatch triggers for manual execution
  - Maintain workflow_run dependencies: daily-update → seo-optimization → prerender-models
  - Validate YAML syntax and dependency chain integrity for all workflows
  - Update workflow comments with new timing rationale and UTC timezone documentation
  - Test that manual triggers work and bypass scheduling constraints
  - Verify rate limiting on sync-docs-to-wiki remains functional (1 hour minimum between runs)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

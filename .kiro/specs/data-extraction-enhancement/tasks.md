# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update data collection limits and configuration constants





  - Define new configuration constants for 90-day window and 200 model limit
  - Replace hardcoded values in _fetch_recent_models() method with RECENT_DAYS_LIMIT = 90
  - Replace hardcoded values in _fetch_top_models() method with TOP_MODELS_LIMIT = 200
  - Increase RECENT_MODELS_API_LIMIT from 500 to 1000 to accommodate larger date window
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 5.1_

- [x] 2. Update all logging messages and documentation strings





  - Update all log messages in _fetch_recent_models() to reference "90 days" instead of "30 days"
  - Update all log messages in _fetch_top_models() to reference "200 models" instead of "50 models"
  - Update method docstrings to reflect new limits (90 days, 200 models)
  - Update class-level documentation and comments to reflect enhanced data collection scope
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 3. Test and validate the enhanced data extraction functionality






  - Create test script to verify the updated limits are correctly applied
  - Test deduplication logic with larger overlapping datasets from both sources
  - Validate that final output contains unique models without duplicates
  - Verify logging output shows correct statistics for 90-day window and 200 top models
  - Test error handling and performance with increased data volume
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.4_

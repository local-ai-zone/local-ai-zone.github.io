# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement core filtering components and configuration





  - Create FilterConfig dataclass with configurable parameters (size thresholds, trusted uploaders, download minimums)
  - Implement ModelClassifier class with finetuning detection patterns and base model grouping
  - Build QuantizationSelector class with trusted uploader support and 5% size threshold logic
  - Add uploader extraction from Hugging Face model IDs and download count validation
  - Create backup management utilities and logging infrastructure
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Build main spam filter engine and processing pipeline








  - Implement SpamFilterEngine class that processes raw model data from `data/raw_models_data.json`
  - Create processing pipeline: extract GGUF files → remove small models → remove finetuned → group by base → filter variants
  - Add model grouping by base architecture with sophisticated variant selection
  - Integrate spam filtering into the model extraction process before final JSON generation
  - Add comprehensive error handling for malformed data and processing failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.4_

- [x] 3. Create single main execution script and reporting system





  - Implement ProcessingReport dataclass with detailed metrics and trusted uploader statistics
  - Add comprehensive report generation showing before/after statistics and removal reasons
  - Create single main script `reduce_model_spam.py` that reads raw data and outputs filtered `gguf_models.json`
  - Add command-line argument parsing and integrate with existing data processing workflow
  - Ensure final output matches the expected `gguf_models.json` format with spam-reduced content
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 4. Develop comprehensive test suite and validation





  - Write unit tests for all core components (FilterConfig, ModelClassifier, QuantizationSelector, SpamFilterEngine)
  - Create integration tests with sample model datasets and edge cases
  - Add performance tests for large dataset processing and validation tests for requirement compliance
  - Test with real model data including small models, finetuned variants, and trusted/untrusted uploaders
  - Validate filtering accuracy and data integrity throughout the process
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

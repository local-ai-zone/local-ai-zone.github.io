# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Enhance the existing GGUF Model Discovery interface with modern UI/UX improvements for better model browsing, searching, and downloading experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean modern interface, so that I can quickly find GGUF models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the site THEN the system SHALL display a modern, clean interface with improved visual hierarchy
2. WHEN a user views model cards THEN the system SHALL show consistent styling with better readability
3. WHEN a user interacts with elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want responsive design, so that I can browse models on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses on mobile THEN the system SHALL display touch-optimized responsive layout
2. WHEN a user navigates on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide adequate touch targets and spacing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user browsing models, I want fast performance, so that I can efficiently explore the catalog.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display content within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL update results in real-time
3. WHEN a user searches THEN the system SHALL provide instant debounced search results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer comparing models, I want enhanced model cards showing all available data, so that I can make informed download decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a model card THEN the system SHALL display all model data: modelName, quantFormat, fileSizeFormatted, modelType, license, downloadCount, with direct download and HuggingFace links
2. WHEN a user wants to download THEN the system SHALL provide clear download buttons for both direct download and HuggingFace links

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user browsing 40,000-100,000 models, I want efficient pagination, so that I can navigate through large datasets without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the model list THEN the system SHALL display 50 model cards per page
2. WHEN a user navigates pages THEN the system SHALL show numbered pagination (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...)
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL sort models by downloadCount (highest first) by default

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user searching through thousands of models, I want comprehensive search and filtering, so that I can find specific models by any criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches THEN the system SHALL search across modelName, quantFormat, modelType, and license fields
2. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL filter by quantFormat, modelType, license, and file size ranges
3. WHEN a user combines search and filters THEN the system SHALL apply both criteria and maintain pagination

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user checking data freshness, I want to see update information, so that I know how current the model data is.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the site THEN the system SHALL display the last update time prominently at the top
2. WHEN a user views the interface THEN the system SHALL show data freshness level indicator

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user browsing models, I want consistent numbering, so that I can track my position in the dataset regardless of sorting or filtering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views model cards THEN the system SHALL display sequential numbers starting from 1
2. WHEN a user sorts or filters data THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent numbering from 1 to the total count
3. WHEN a user navigates pages THEN the system SHALL continue numbering sequence across pages

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want modular architecture, so that the code is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the UI THEN the system SHALL use modular JavaScript files with single responsibilities
2. WHEN writing code THEN each file SHALL not exceed 500 lines of code
3. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into distinct modules (components, services, state, utils)

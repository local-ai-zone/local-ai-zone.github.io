# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures that prerendered model pages accurately reflect the latest upload date information from the GGUF model data. Currently, prerendered pages may contain outdated upload date information if they were generated before the model data was updated with new upload dates. This feature will implement a system to detect when upload dates have changed and trigger appropriate prerendering updates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing prerendered model pages, I want to see the most current upload date information, so that I can make informed decisions about model freshness and relevance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model's upload date is updated in gguf_models.json THEN the corresponding prerendered page SHALL reflect the new upload date within the next prerendering cycle
2. WHEN prerendering is triggered THEN the system SHALL use the latest upload date data from gguf_models.json
3. WHEN a prerendered page is generated THEN it SHALL include the upload date information in a user-visible format
4. WHEN multiple models have upload date changes THEN all affected prerendered pages SHALL be updated

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the site, I want the prerendering system to automatically detect upload date changes, so that I don't need to manually track which pages need updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the daily data update workflow runs THEN the system SHALL compare current upload dates with previously prerendered data
2. WHEN upload date changes are detected THEN the system SHALL trigger selective prerendering for affected models
3. WHEN no upload date changes are detected THEN the system SHALL skip unnecessary prerendering to save resources
4. WHEN prerendering fails for specific models THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue processing other models

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want to ensure prerendered pages display upload dates in a consistent and readable format, so that users can easily understand when models were uploaded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an upload date is displayed on a prerendered page THEN it SHALL be formatted in a human-readable format (e.g., "March 7, 2024")
2. WHEN an upload date is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL display a fallback message (e.g., "Upload date not available")
3. WHEN upload dates are very recent THEN the system SHALL highlight them as "Recently uploaded" or similar
4. WHEN upload dates are displayed THEN they SHALL be consistent across both minimal pages and full prerendered pages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the upload date synchronization to integrate seamlessly with existing workflows, so that it doesn't disrupt current automation processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the daily update workflow runs THEN upload date synchronization SHALL be integrated into the existing process
2. WHEN prerendering is triggered manually THEN it SHALL also include upload date synchronization
3. WHEN upload date changes are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing prerendered page formats
4. WHEN errors occur during upload date processing THEN they SHALL not prevent the overall workflow from completing successfully
